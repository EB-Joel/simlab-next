# Creating a Lab Report

#### Open the Lab Report Screen

Navigate to the **Lab Report** page by either selecting the **Lab Report** link from the top bar (option 1), or the **Start a Lab Report** button from the front page (option 2).

#### Modify the Report Settings

Change settings by clicking the **Change Report Settings** button at the bottom of the settings box. In the settings window that appears, modify the **Patient**, **Tests**, and **Diseases** settings as desired, by selecting the appropriate tab at the top left of the window.

Click the **Save Changes** button at the lower-right corner of the settings window to save the new settings and close the settings window.

In order to avoid overwriting previous work, SimLab will not overwrite a lab report unless explicitly told to. The **Generate New Report** button should now be pulsating, indicating that there are new settings that have not yet been applied. Click on it now to generate a new lab report with the new settings:

SimLab currently supports creating a custom SimLab account, as well as linking your Google account. After signing in, you should see a profile picture or your initials in a small circle in the top right. You can click on this icon in order sign out.

#### Saving a Lab Report

When signed in and on the **Lab Report** page, the 'Save Report' button will now be enabled in the command toolbar to the right of the lab report:

_N.B.: the_ **_Update Saved Report_** _command will be disabled unless you have a previously-saved lab report open._

Click on the **Save Report As...** button to open the save report dialog:

This allows setting of three options:

1. _Report Name_: a unique identifier or name for this report, should briefly describe what the case is.
2. _Tags_: Categories or keywords for this report. These can be shared between reports to allow searching for particular characteristics.
3. _Is Public_: If this option is enabled, anyone with the sharing link can view the lab report, and save a copy of it to their own account. If it is disabled, only the creating user can view the lab report.

After setting the save options, press the **Save Report** button to save the lab report.

##### Updating a Lab Report

If the current lab report has previously been saved, the underlying saved report can be updated with any changes. **Note that this overwrites the previous report values, which will be lost**. Updating is performed by selecting the **Update Saved Report** button, which will open the same save report dialog as seen in the previous section, but with the existing save settings already entered and ready to be modified.

#### Loading a Saved Lab Report

Previously saved lab reports can be loaded from the _Saved Lab Reports_ screen. Pressing the **Load Report** button in the command toolbar. The _Saved Lab Reports_ screen shows a list of lab reports that have been saved to the currently signed-in account:

The list can be filtered by typing keywords in the \*_Search..._ box. The _Report Name_ and _Tags_ of saved reports will be searched for the entered keyword.

After locating the desired lab report, clicking **Load Report** will load the selected report and display it in the **Lab Report** screen.

#### Deleting a Saved Lab Report

Saved lab reports may be deleted from the signed-in account by clicking on the ![](images/help/delete-saved.png) icon. A prompt to confirm deletion will be displayed, and if confirmed the report will be **irreversibly** deleted.

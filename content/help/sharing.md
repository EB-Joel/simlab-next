# Sharing Lab Reports

Lab reports can easily be shared with other users by copying the shareable link. In order to share a lab report, the report must first have been saved to a user's profile, and must have been made publicly available by selecting the relevant option in the save report window:

When the lab is loaded in the **Lab Report** screen, the **Share** button will become active. Clicking on this button reveals the shareable link, and a button to copy the shareable link:

When the clipboard icon button is clicked, it will copy the link to the current lab report to the clipboard, and if successful will change to an icon of a clipboard with a checkmark:

Anyone with the shareable link can now view the lab report as long as the _Allow this lab report to be viewed by anyone_ option remains set.

#### Copying a Shared Lab Report to Your Own User Profile

If another user's shared lab report is opened while you are logged in, you may use the **Save Report As...** button to save a new copy of the same lab report to your own user profile.
